  - `Atmosphere + Fusee` [From Here](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/latest)
  - `SigPatches` [From Here](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases/latest)
- Place `fusee.bin` in  `/bootloader/payloads`
- Create `hekate_ipl.ini` in `/bootloader`
- Create `exosphere.ini` in your root folder
- Create a `/hosts` folder in `/atmosphere`
- Write a `default.txt` in `/atmosphere/hosts`, blocking Nintendo Servers
